## Reminder Logic

- Polls every 30 seconds for upcoming posts
- When a post is 1 minute away:
  - Displays a toast notification
  - Plays the reminder audio file (reminder.mp3)
- Audio playback only occurs if the tab is visible
- Ensures reminders do not repeat using:
  - `notified` flag
  - ✅ `shownToastIds` set (prevents duplicate reminders even if state lags)
