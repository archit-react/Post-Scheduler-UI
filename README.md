# Post-Scheduler-UI
A sleek and intuitive web app that lets you schedule posts with custom date and time, and get notified with an audio reminder 1 minute before your scheduled time. Built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, it features a clean macOS-style UI, local post storage via localStorage, and a live countdown using date-fns.
